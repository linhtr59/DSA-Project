Implementation

Results maintain a reference to the id of the company
Owners network is represented by Graph datastructure implementing adjacency list. 
As we loop throgh queries, we intialised the current owner id in result to be -1 (does not exist) and use two stack 
to store the data. 


Proof of correctness



Complexity:
Time complexity for the current implementation is O(NQ) where N is the number of owners and Q is the number 
of queries. 

Construction of graph: loop through all owners to add into graph takes O(N) times
Identifying subsidiaries: require query array to be traversed to investigate each query to find payer and payee. 

Thus total complexity (amortized as we could not have used isadjacent method of graph if graph was not constructed)
is O(NQ).
